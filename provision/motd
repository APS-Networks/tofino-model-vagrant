APS Networks Tofino Model VM - Quickstart
=========================================

Welcome to APS Network's Tofino model virtual machine!

For detailed documentation, please check http://localhost:8000 from your guest.
Online documentation can be disable by removing the associated port forwarding
rule in the Vagrant config. This does not require a re-provision; the vm can be 
halted and brought back up.

* The SDE and it's installation can be found at ~/bf-sde-9.7.0.
* The folder synchronised with the host is found at ~/work
* The provided example program is found at ~/work/example

Navigate to ~/work/example and run ./tmux_session.sh. This will provide you 
with instructions on how to:
* Build and install the program
* Run the model and bf_switchd
* Modify the loaded pipeline
* Test packet processing

Otherwise bf-p4c is in $PATH, and the $SDE and $SDE_INSTALL arguments have
been added to the environment.
